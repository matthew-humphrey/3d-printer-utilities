# BearExxa using Vertigo's PulleyBox which has a 7:2 gear ratio (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3714978)
#   Full steps per rotation (1.8 degree stepper) = (360/1.8) = 200 steps/rotation
#   16 micro-steps / step
#   490 micro-steps per mm
#   3.5:1 (7:2) gear ratio 
#   Approximate rotation distance relative to motor:
#       200 steps/motor-rotation * 16 micro-steps/step / (490 micro-steps/mm) = 6.531 mm/motor-rotation
#   We must adjust this value by the 3.5:1 gear ratio - 3.5 rotations of the motor for every 1 rotation 
#   of the final (filament contacting) gear because the Klipper rotation_distance is in terms of one
#   rotation of the final gear. We multiply the value above by the number of revolutions the motor needs
#   to make for 1 full rotation of the final gear, which in this case is 7 / 2 = (3.5). This yields a
#   final value of 22.857.
#
#   The value below was measured, so includes some slip of the filament in the gear and hence is slightly different.
